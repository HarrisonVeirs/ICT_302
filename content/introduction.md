I am from the state of Kentucky, in a city called Crestwood. I have been a lifelong fan of Kentucky Basketball and Football. Being able to watch the Cats under Calipari has been **so awesome**. I also love watch the NBA and the NFL. I love music as well and listen to almost every genre. I am an avid movie watcher, as well as a *few* TV shows here and there. I have 5 other members in my family, 2 parents, 2 younger sisters and one younger brother. I also have 3 dogs, 2 goldendoodles and one mini-labradoodle.
