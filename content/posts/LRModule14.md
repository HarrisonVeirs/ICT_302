I **can** identify and define key concepts in (web) content management because I know how to research credible sources that explain these concepts to me.

I **can** manage content using established workflows because I have practiced with my group this semester a good workflow for the whole team in a smooth process.

I **can** describe and compare content management systems because I have looked at and researched different ones this semester.

I **can** identify and employ technologies related to content management systems because I have used Hugo and WordPress and also looked at many plugins for WordPress that can be used for various reasons.

I **can** find and use resources for self-directed learning because I have learned how to properly research for credible sources, in this class and other classes. I have used different pages on WordPress help and FAQ and used it in some occasions during blog posts and group assignments.
