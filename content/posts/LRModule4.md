I **can** identify and define key concepts in (web) content management using Deane Barkerâ€™s content management glossary.

I **can** manage content using established workflows because I have read how Deane Barker describes different roles of a content management team.

I **can** describe and compare content management systems because I looked at the different considerations that compare each content management system's features.

I didn't do much to identify and employ technologies related to content management.

I didn't do much to find and use resources for self-directed learning.
