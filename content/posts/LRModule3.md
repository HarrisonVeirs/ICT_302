I **can** identify and define key concepts in (web) content management using Deane Barkerâ€™s content management glossary.
I **can** manage content using established workflows because I have read how Deane Barker describes different roles of a content management team.
I didn't do much to describe and compare content management systems.
I didn't do much to identify and employ technologies related to content management.
I didn't do much to find and use resources for self-directed learning.
