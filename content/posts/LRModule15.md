I **can** identify and define key concepts in (web) content management because I have spent plenty of time researching terms in general and when it comes to web content management key terms, I can find credible websites to help me understand these terms because of my research.

I **can** manage content using established workflows because this semester I have had a ton of online homework, and often every day of the week, with some days having multiple classes' homework. I have had to organize each week and figure out my homework schedule ahead of time.

I **can** describe and compare content management systems because this semester I have by myself and with my group look at different systems and also used different systems.

I **can** identify and employ technologies related to content management systems because this semester I have researched different technologies and used different technologies. Technologies such as plugins for WordPress.

I **can** find and use resources for self-directed learning because between all five of my online classes this semseter, I have been required to research many things, and the practice of that has made me better at learning things by searching by myself.
